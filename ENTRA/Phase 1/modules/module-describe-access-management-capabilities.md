## 🎯 What I learned
- What Conditional Access is and when it’s used.
- How Entra ID roles and RBAC provide structured access control.
- The purpose of Global Secure Access in Microsoft's SSE platform.
- How access decisions depend on identity, authentication, conditions, and role assignments.

## 🧠 Key takeaways
- RBAC = core access control model in Entra ID (fundamental for Phase 1).
- Conditional Access introduces policy-based, adaptive access (advanced).
- Access management = identity + authentication + conditions + permissions.
- Global Secure Access integrates identity-driven and network-level access.
- Strong access controls enforce Zero Trust principles.
