## 🎯 What I learned
- What Microsoft Entra ID is and how it is used as a cloud directory.
- Differences between Entra ID and Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS).
- How Entra ID enables identity management for cloud applications.
- The purpose and differences of Microsoft Entra ID P1 and P2.
- What Microsoft Entra Domain Services (EDDS) is used for.

## 🧠 Key takeaways
- Entra ID = cloud-based identity and access platform (replaces many AD DS scenarios for modern environments).
- AD DS = on-premises directory service; Entra ID = cloud identity — they are **not** the same.
- P1 adds identity governance and Conditional Access; P2 adds advanced risk-based protection.
- Entra Domain Services = AD DS–compatible domain features **without domain controllers**.
- Modern apps authenticate through Entra ID, not through traditional AD DS.
