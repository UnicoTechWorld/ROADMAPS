## 🎯 What I learned
- The authentication methods supported in Microsoft Entra ID (password, FIDO2, Windows Hello, Temporary Access Pass, etc.).
- How multifactor authentication (MFA) increases identity security.
- How self-service password reset (SSPR) works and when it can be enabled.
- How password protection and banned password lists help defend against weak credentials.

## 🧠 Key takeaways
- Authentication is the foundation of identity security — MFA drastically reduces account compromise.
- Entra ID supports **modern, phishing-resistant** authentication methods.
- SSPR improves user experience and reduces helpdesk workload.
- Password protection enforces strong credentials across hybrid and cloud environments.
- Good authentication strategy = essential Phase 1 knowledge before Conditional Access.
