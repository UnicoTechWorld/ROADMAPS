## 🎯 What I learned
- How to create, configure, and manage **users** in Microsoft Entra ID.
- How to create and manage **groups** (security & Microsoft 365 groups).
- How license assignment works (direct assignment vs. group-based licensing).
- How custom security attributes can be used to classify and control identities.
- Basics of **automatic user provisioning** in connected applications.

## 🧠 Key takeaways
- Identities must be centrally managed to ensure correct access for each user and resource.
- Group-based management simplifies permissions, licensing, and provisioning.
- Security attributes allow structured, consistent classification of identities.
- Automatic user provisioning reduces manual work and ensures lifecycle consistency.
- “Least privilege” starts with correctly designed user & group identity structures.
