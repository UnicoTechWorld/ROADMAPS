# Entra ID – Complete Identity & Access Engineering Project

This repository contains my full multi-phase learning and implementation project around Microsoft Entra ID, covering identity foundation, Conditional Access, device identity, and governance.

The goal of the project is to simulate real-world identity engineering work by progressively designing, building, and securing an enterprise-grade Entra environment across several phases.

---

## Project Structure Overview

This repository is organized into multiple high-level phases:

### **Phase 1 – Identity Foundation**
Focuses on:
- User lifecycle structure
- Security groups & access modeling
- Group-based licensing
- MFA & SSPR configuration
- Privileged role separation
- Internal onboarding & external guest access  
➡️ *All practical labs for Phase 1 are in:*  
`/PROJECT/lab_project_phase1/`

### **Phase 2 – Conditional Access (Zero Trust)**
Will focus on:
- User and app access policies
- Location & risk-based controls
- Identity Protection signals
- Authentication strengths  
➡️ *Future practical labs will be added under:*  
`/PROJECT/lab_project_phase2/`

### **Phase 3 – Device Identity & Compliance**
Will focus on:
- Intune device registration & management
- Compliance policies
- Device-based access conditions
- Integration with Conditional Access

### **Phase 4 – Identity Governance**
Will focus on:
- Lifecycle workflows
- Access packages
- Access reviews
- Guest governance and entitlement management

## Scenario

A fictional company is used throughout the project to simulate real-world identity challenges.

Full business context is available here:  
`Scenario.md`

## Purpose of This Project

This project demonstrates my hands-on capability to:

- Design and build an enterprise-ready identity architecture  
- Translate business needs into Entra ID configurations  
- Secure identities using strong baseline controls  
- Document engineering work clearly and professionally  
- Progress through the full lifecycle of Identity & Access Management  

Each phase builds on top of the previous one, creating a learning path that mirrors actual Modern Workplace / IAM engineering roles.

## Lab Material

Phase 1 labs are located here:

`/PROJECT/lab_project_phase1/`

Future lab folders will be added as additional phases are completed.

## Status

- **Phase 1 – Completed ✔️**  
- **Phase 2 – In progress (starting soon)**  
- **Phase 3 – Planned**  
- **Phase 4 – Planned**

This repository will continue to grow as I progress through the entire Entra ecosystem, from foundational identity management to advanced governance and automation.
